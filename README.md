# Outreachy Tasks

We are excited to welcome new contributors to the networkx project! 

To participate with NetworkX as an Outreachy intern applicants are expected to go through multiple tasks in this repository. All tasks are presented as [issues](https://github.com/networkx/outreachy/issues) in this repository. Everyone is expected to do the [first task](https://github.com/networkx/outreachy/issues/2).

Feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions/5396) if there are any questions regarding the process!
